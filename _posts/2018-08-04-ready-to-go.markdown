This is mainly just a time for me to have fun `messing around` with code, but also an opportunity to vent about my upcoming challenge in life: college.

#### It is not easy to forget...

​		A couple of months ago I was sitting in a chair in the heat with a green graduation uniform on and my high honor roll ribbons wrapped around my neck. My shirt and tie and dress pants did not make me feel any more comfortable. The hot and falling sun should have fazed me and my peers far more than it did, but we did not really care about that. All we cared about was having the chance to get called up to receive our diploma. That was the whole point of the ceremony was it not? Anyone can tie a deeper meaning to the ceremony to sound humble and majestic, but in reality *everyone* knew it was the final thing that had to be done to leave high school.

​		Leaving high school was something I knew was going to happen, but was not exactly ready for. Like most people, I worried about how I would continue to go on without many of my friends once college began. I knew many of those who I grew close with would not be around me in Pittsburgh. Over the last few months I have realized that it is not easy to forget the experiences I had talking to my peers every weekday for hours on end. To be honest, I miss it. 

​		All I can hope for as I move to my next chapter at the University of Pittsburgh is that I can adjust.
