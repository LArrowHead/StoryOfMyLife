I was born in a small town about 40 minutes outside of Pittsburgh, PA. I grew up playing all sorts of sports; soccer, baseball, hockey and many more. I was never insanely good at these sports, but I had a deep passion to continue to play and learn how to improve on the norm. My parents also signed me up for Cub Scouts, where I began a lot of the things that I would be missing in school. 

School has always been something I openly dread but secretly enjoy. It allows me to contribute to discussions and express my feelings about certain things while simultaneously learning more about others. I have always been someone who is fond of learning new things; sometimes too fond. As I have grown in age, my goals for a career have continued to change. 

When I first began high school I knew that I wanted to do something with computers. I had always taken my free-time to code websites or copy those video tutorials on the Internet. It was my passion and it remained that way until my Junior year, when something changed. I found my new passion: Foreign Languages.

Foreign Languages are the most fascinating thing for me because of the mystery of the culture behind the words. I want to learn more about people who speak the most-common and least-common languages, but I know now that it is ambitious to expect to learn a language quickly. 

My passion to learn languages and explore cultures led me down another path as well: International Affairs. International Affairs seems like the most logical way to explore my desire of learning languages and exploring cultures. The prospect of also being involved in government is something I gained interest with from my last year in high school. I enjoy voicing my perspective on certain government issues and quite like the idea of influencing American involvement in the world. 

As I begin my first semester in college, I cannot help but be excited to start this new chapter in my life.
